# Twitter Bot

This is a simple Twitter bot created by @sonnymay. It uses Python and the Tweepy library to interact with the Twitter API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Python installed on your local machine. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You will also need the Tweepy library. You can install it with pip:

```bash
pip install tweepy
```

### Twitter API

To use this project, you will also need access to the Twitter API. You can apply for access [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access).

Once you have access, you should create an app to get your API keys and access tokens. These are required to authenticate with the Twitter API.

## Usage

To use the bot, you should run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

By default, the bot will post a tweet saying "Hello, world!" You can customize this behavior by editing `main.py`.

This is just a simple example. Depending on the complexity of your project, you might want to include more details. For example, you could include a section on how to run the tests for your project, if applicable. Also, make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual API keys and tokens before running the script.
